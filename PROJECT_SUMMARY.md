# 🎮 Sustainability Game - Project Summary

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Phaser game project is now set up and ready to use. The development server is running at **http://localhost:5173/**

## 🎯 What's Working Now

✅ **Player Entity**

-   Physics-enabled sprite
-   Arrow key movement (with smooth diagonal movement)
-   Walking animation (0→1→0→2 cycle)
-   Character flips when moving left/right
-   HP system (5 HP max)
-   Bin carrying state tracking

✅ **Game Scene**

-   Player spawns at center
-   HP display in top-left
-   Instructions on screen
-   Ready for additional entities

✅ **Configuration**

-   1280x720 game resolution
-   Arcade physics (top-down, no gravity)
-   Auto-scaling and centering
-   Responsive canvas

## 🚀 Next Step: Add Your Sprites

1. **Copy your player sprite files:**

    ```
    player.png  →  public/assets/sprites/player.png
    player.json →  public/assets/sprites/player.json
    ```

2. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:5173/

3. **Test movement** with arrow keys!

## 🎮 Controls

-   **Arrow Keys**: Move player in 8 directions
-   **SPACE**: Interaction (ready for bin pickup - to be implemented)

## 📝 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Player Movement ✅ COMPLETE

-   [x] Player sprite loading with TexturePacker atlas
-   [x] Movement system (arrow keys)
-   [x] Walking animation system
-   [x] HP tracking
-   [x] Bin carrying state

### Phase 2: Game Entities (Next Steps)

-   [ ] Create Bin class (green, blue, yellow)
-   [ ] Create Trash class (various categories)
-   [ ] Create DropoffBox class (waste-to-energy, recycling, donation)
-   [ ] Add sprites for all entities

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics

-   [ ] Bin pickup system (SPACE key)
-   [ ] Trash collection system
-   [ ] Collision detection
-   [ ] HP loss for wrong trash
-   [ ] Bin capacity system
-   [ ] Deposit at dropoff points

### Phase 4: UI & Game States

-   [ ] Game Over screen
-   [ ] Main menu
-   [ ] Restart functionality
-   [ ] Score/progress tracking

## 🔧 Code Organization

The project follows **separation of concerns**:

-   **Entities** (`/entities`): Game objects (Player, Bin, Trash, etc.)
-   **Scenes** (`/scenes`): Game states and level management
-   **Config** (`/config`): Phaser configuration and constants
-   **Assets** (`/public/assets`): Sprites, sounds, etc.

## 💡 Tips

-   Player animation expects frames 0, 1, 2 in your atlas
-   HP system is already implemented and displays in top-left
-   The player is collision-enabled and world-bound ready
-   All entity properties (isCarryingBin, currentBinType) are ready for game logic

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

Check the browser console for errors about:

-   Missing sprite files
-   Incorrect frame references
-   Loading issues

The game will still run but you'll see error messages to guide you.
